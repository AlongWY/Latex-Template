    \item {WI input method needs to be ported to a small-capacity ARM platform machine, and some new functions need to be added, including English input method and dictionary editing tool.}
    \item {I am mainly responsible for the design and development of English input methods (including word prediction, word correction, etc.) and dictionary editing tools.}
    \item {The English input method has not found the memory leak problem at present, the running effect and the transplant effect are good, the resource consumption is relatively small, and the dictionary editing tool can complete the dictionary editing function in Chinese and English.}

    \item {The project is mainly used for news aggregation search of major platforms, especially for entertainment news.}
    \item {I completed the front and back of the project independently, the front end uses Bootstrap, the back end uses Django + uwgi + nginx + mysql + ElasticSearch, and Scrapy is used as a crawler.}
    \item {The project is currently in use internally, and the functions are basically normal, but when the crawled news items are too high, the speed will be slower and some optimization is made.}

    \item {In order to improve network load and computing efficiency, the \href{https://www.ltp-cloud.com/}{LTP Cloud Platform} needs to be micro-serviced and improve the parallel processing capability of the program. At present, the underlying machine learning library cannot complete the corresponding functions.}
    \item {I am mainly responsible for the development of the machine learning library which is based on an existing machine learning library. The memory model of the library has been modified so that it can support multi-calculation graph multi-process operations.}
    \item {The underlying library has been deployed to the services of the LTP Cloud Platform, and the state is good.}
